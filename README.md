## A Ridiculously complex way to print "Hello, World" in the terminal! Using the easiest to program language to print "Hello, World" in!
This weird program runs in Python! And uses absoultly NO librarys!
You can add to the issues if you wish to update parts of the code!
I would love some help on making this even MORE Ridiculous!
## How to Install & Run!
First you need to Clone the Repo!
```
git clone https://github.com/rhhen122/complex-hello-world.git
```
Then, Run main.py!

python3 complex-hello-world/main.py
```
